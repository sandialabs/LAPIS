spmv.mlir contains a simple high-level MLIR program that computes SpMV
(sparse matrix times dense vector). This was generated by MPACT and torch-mlir,
and then modified to take the output vector %y as a parameter instead of allocating
it inside the function during every call. The original version was correct for the
way torch executes models, but we found that allocating the vector in each call
incurred significant overhead compared to the actual SpMV.

The other files in this directory (KokkosSparse_CrsMatrix.hpp, KokkosSparse_IOUtils.hpp,
Kokkos_StaticCrsGraph.hpp) are just used to parse MatrixMarket files into CSR sparse matrices using Kokkos
(which can be passed to the LAPIS-generated kernel directly).

The script runLAPIS.sh will apply the LAPIS pipeline to spmv.mlir, generating the
file spmv.hpp.

Unlike the other benchmarks, spmv takes the path to the matrix as a command-line argument.
